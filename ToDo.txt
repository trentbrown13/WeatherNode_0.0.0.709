Not Started: 
In NodeRed, find way to edit one blob for a tab and use it for other tabs.
Example: Only use the GUI to edit the Wemos test tab as a template for the the
other tabs. Do a search and replace on that blob and save as the other tabs.

DONE 03/01/2019. Grafana running on MesaPi1, all nodes being graphed - very cool!
Install Grafana and InfluxDB to RPI and use for graphing historical data
points.

IN PROGRESS Code Cleanup
perhaps move function declarations, functions and globals to a header file, create small library
for publish/serial/lcd print sensor readings.

1: create WeatherNodes.h file
2: in WeatherNodes.h
  #ifndef WEATHER_NODES_H
  #define WEATHER_NODES_H
  #include <arduino.h> etc - all include files
etc - look at bottom of above link


Add ifdef for pin definitions
#define HW_V1
#define HW_V2

#ifdef HW_V1


Not Started: 
Add Deep Sleep in two steps.

Note: THIS WILL REQUIRE HW CHANGE!
Step1: Manual Deep Sleep controled via mqtt (Node Red) with timer adjustment
	enabled/disabled boolean - default:disabled
	deepSleepTime range 1hr - 12 hr; default:1hr
Step2: Auto Deep Sleep triggered by VCC low voltage over period of time
