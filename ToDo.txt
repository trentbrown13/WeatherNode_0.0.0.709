Not Started: 
In NodeRed, find way to edit one blob for a tab and use it for other tabs.
Example: Only use the GUI to edit the Wemos test tab as a template for the the
other tabs. Do a search and replace on that blob and save as the other tabs.

DONE 03/01/2019. Grafana running on MesaPi1, all nodes being graphed - very cool!
Install Grafana and InfluxDB to RPI and use for graphing historical data
points.

IN PROGRESS Code Cleanup
	perhaps move function declaration to header file, create small library
for publish/serial/lcd print sensor readings

Not Started: 
Add Deep Sleep in two steps.

Note: THIS WILL REQUIRE HW CHANGE!
Step1: Manual Deep Sleep controled via mqtt (Node Red) with timer adjustment
	enabled/disabled boolean - default:disabled
	deepSleepTime range 1hr - 12 hr; default:1hr
Step2: Auto Deep Sleep triggered by VCC low voltage over period of time
